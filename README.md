📊 Customer Satisfaction & Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes Amazon customer behavior to predict customer satisfaction and churn risk using machine learning techniques. The study applies Logistic Regression and XGBoost models to identify key behavioral factors influencing customer retention and recommendation effectiveness.

Using an Amazon customer behavior dataset from Kaggle (2023–2024), the project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to support data-driven decision-making for e-commerce platforms.
